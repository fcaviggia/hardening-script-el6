# Configuration now part of apply.sh - uses the following files:
#  - config/system-auth-local > /etc/pam.d/system-auth-local > /etc/pam.d/system-auth
#  - config/password-auth-local > /etc/pam.d/password-auth-local > /etc/pam.d/system-auth
#  - config/gnome-screensaver /etc/pam.d/gnome-screensaver

# auth config overwrites these changes, make it non executable
